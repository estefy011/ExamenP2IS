## SOAP Integration
The service integrates with a SOAP endpoint to check room availability before creating reservations. The SOAP endpoint URL is configured in the `create_reservation_ui` function.

## Run the Server
To start the REST API service:
```bash
python api.py
```
The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.

## Testing
Use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the API endpoints. You can also use the provided web interface for creating, viewing, and canceling reservations.
